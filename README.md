## -Learning From Sensor Data-

# 1. Project Task
Our project is to investigate the relationship between different attributes and learn some potential rules from the dataset provided by SICK. 
We are given 5 expectation questions which are:

•	Across the entire dataset, what can we learn about _package trends_ with respect to LFT (Legal For Trade) and NotLFT (not Legal For Trade) conditions.

•	How does the belt speed behave across time? Are there any correlations between belt speed and NotLFT (or LFT)?

•	Investigate “Gap” information and determine if there are any observable outliers. Correlate this information with the differences in the timestamps between adjacent packages

•	What can we learn about “Pileup” or “Log Jam” situations? Are trends in conditions such as Irreg, MultiRead, TooBig indicative of this phenomenon?

•	In general, identify outliers in the data: 

o	Random changes in the units – example: ft/min changes to m/sec

o	Total Throughput changes, Specific throughput based on conditions

o	Recurring errors observed in the Heart Beat data section

To sum up, We need to build a classification model which the output label is LFT and the input attributes are other condistions and information. We also need to figure out how to transfer package trends, 'Pileyp', 'Log Jam' to clear data.
